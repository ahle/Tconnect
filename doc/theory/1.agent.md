# Part I: Multi agents in collaborative editing

*Human agent*

The users interact with the editing sytems for correcting the documents such as i.e. editor, system designer.

*Assistance agent*

An intelligence agent observes user interaction and helps the users.

*Environment*

TConnect Editor v0, the enviroment types is defined D-SOAKEDS:

* Fully observable (vs. partially observable)
* Deterministic (vs. stochastic)
* Episodic (vs. sequential)
* Static (vs. dynamic)
* Discrete (vs. continuous)
* Single agent (vs. multiagent)

Our environment is semi-dynamic, partially observable, stochastic, sequential, discrete and multiagent.

We assume that the human agents could be different based on their personalization. Four basic types in order of increasing generality:

* Simple reflex agents
* Reflex agents with state
* Goal-based agents
* Utility-based agents
* All these can be turned into learning agents
* Obviously, in the 1st case, if the user acts as simple reflex agent. The A-Model in CTM method provides a very good way to learn the conditions of user action.
