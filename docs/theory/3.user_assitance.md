# User assistance

In this section, we describe the dimensions used in TConnect for user assistance.

* Information retention (memory)
* Planning
* Search 
* User perference based on utility function

There are two methods of user assitance: user assistance based on user activity and user assistance based on user-level.

The first application of user assistance based on user activity is trace visualisation.

The level of assistance based on the different level of human agent.
If the user is a simle reflex agent


One of the important steps of user assistance is user classification.
In Tconnect, the user profil contains two kinds of information about the user.

#### User Assistance by reacting UX

#### User Assistance by boosting User Performance

<!--
In this section, we suppose in somehow we could represent the UX by a point in experience space. 

x <- c(5,9,3)
y <- c(10,11,12)
labels <- c("UX(u1)","UX(u2)","UX(u3)")
plot(x,y, 
     main= "User Experience",
     xlab= "Features",
     ylab= "Methods",
     col= "blue", pch = 19, cex = 1, lty = "solid", lwd = 2,
     xlim=c(0, 15), ylim=c(0, 15))

text(x,y, labels=labels, cex= 1.5)
