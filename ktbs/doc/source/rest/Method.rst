Method
======

Creation
--------

A computed trace is created by a POST query to a `Base`. It must have the following properties:

* http://liris.cnrs.fr/silex/2009/ktbs#contains linking from the Base
* http://liris.cnrs.fr/silex/2009/ktbs#inherits

It can optionally have the following properties:

* http://liris.cnrs.fr/silex/2009/ktbs#hasParameter 

GET

In addition to the query-string parameters accepted by any trace, computed traces allow for the parameter ``quick`` to force the retrieval of the *current* state of the trace, even if its content is not up to date.

PUT

DELETE

Not implemented yet. TODO decide what to do if computed traces use this method.
