Obsel
=====

Obsels (short for 'Observed elements') are the atomic elements of traces. An obsel is described by the following elements:

* an obsel type,
* a begin timestamp,
* an end timestamp (that can equal the begin timestamp).

It can also have multiple attributes, and be linked to other obsels of the same trace through binary relations.

The obsel type, the attributes and the relations are described by a :doc:`trace model <trace_model>`.
