Overview of the General Concepts
================================

While in classical (relation) DBMSs a database contains tables, in kTBS a base contains traces (as well as other kinds of objects that we will describe later).

A trace aims at representing an activity as a set of **obsels** (observed element). Each obsel has, at least, a *type* and two *timestamps* (begin and end). It can also have an arbitrary number of **attributes** and **relations** with other obsels. Basically, this is all there is to know about obsels.

A trace is also linked to a **trace model**, which can be stored in the same base in the kTBS, or anywhere on the web. The trace model describes the obsel types that the trace can contain, their attributes and their relations. A trace model is to a trace roughly what a schema is to a trace in an RDBMS â€”except that a trace model has an identity of its own, and can be shared by several traces.

Finally, traces can either be **stored** or **computed**. While stored traces contain data that is explicitly put there by external applications, obsels in computed traces are automatically generated based on a computation. That computation is specified by a **method**, either built-in or stored in the base together with traces and trace models.
