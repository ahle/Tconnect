RESTful API
===========

This chapter describes the API of kTBS. The alternative is to use a dedicated API in your programming language of choice, ideally mapped to the `abstract API <../concepts/abstract_api>`:doc:. The :doc:`developper's section <devel>` of this documentation contains a (still incomplete) client API for Python, but Java_, ActionScript_ and PHP_ implementations are also in development.

.. _PHP: http://liris.cnrs.fr/~sbt-dev/ktbs/php-client
