Authentication
==============

For the moment, kTBS does not include any authentication mechanism. However, as a WSGI_ application, it can be either:

* wrapped in a WSGI middleware managing authentication (see the WSGI_ website);
* hosted by a standard web server, such as Apache_, with its own authentication mechanism.

.. _Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/
